yaxim (Yet Another XMPP Instant Messenger)
==========================================

yaxim is a Jabber/XMPP client with open source (GPLv2). Why pay for SMS if you can have unlimited messaging on your data plan?

yaxim aims at security, low overhead and keeping your server connection open. So far, it only supports a single account.


## Features

The following is already supported:

 * Connection with a single XMPP server (or GTalk, or Facebook Chat, or ...)
 * You are asked about self-signed SSL certificates
 * Allows automatic connection after turning on your phone
 * Reconnect on 3G/WiFi network change
 * Chat with your buddies (all messages are stored)
 * Adding/removing buddies from the roster
 * Delivery receipts (XEP-0184)
 * Message carbons (XEP-0280)

## Build Instructions

yaxim is written in Java and source code is maintained in `git`. The official
repository is [pfleidi's](https://github.com/pfleidi/yaxim), most development
work happens in [ge0rg's repo](https://github.com/ge0rg/yaxim). You will need
the Android SDK and `ant` to compile.

To compile yaxim, the following steps need to be taken:

	# fetch source code from github
	git clone git@github.com:pfleidi/yaxim.git
	cd yaxim
	
	# initialize submodules
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	
	# prepare android build (with subprojects)
	android update project -p . -s
	android update project -p ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock
	android update project -p MemorizingTrustManager --subprojects
	
	# compile debug version
	ant proguard debug
	
	# compile release version
	ant proguard release


## Building without `ant`

If you are using a different build environment, consider the following things:

 * You need to generate `res/values/version.xml` containing the `build_version` string. The template is in `version.xml.tpl`.
 * Without ProGuard, the compiled binary will be around 30% larger.
